[NCI Cloud Resources](https://cbiit.cancer.gov/ncip/crdc-cloud-resources) - The Cloud Resources bring together data and computation in a cloud-based environment to enable cancer research and discovery.  
The NCI Cloud Resources, launched as a pilot program in 2016, are providing cancer researchers access to genomic data co-located with elastic compute and a variety of analytic tools and pipelines, in a cloud environment. Many in the cancer research community have come to rely on the Cloud Resources built by the Broad Institute, the Institute for Systems Biology (ISB), and Seven Bridges (SB) for their cancer research.

[NCI Cloud Resources](https://cbiit.cancer.gov/ncip/crdc-cloud-resources) - [NCI] - The Cloud Resources bring together data and computation in a cloud-based environment to enable cancer research and discovery.  The NCI Cloud Resources, launched as a pilot program in 2016, are providing cancer researchers access to genomic data co-located with elastic compute and a variety of analytic tools and pipelines, in a cloud environment. Many in the cancer research community have come to rely on the Cloud Resources built by the Broad Institute, the Institute for Systems Biology (ISB), and Seven Bridges (SB) for their cancer research.  

[Nephele](https://nephele.niaid.nih.gov/) - [NIAID] - Nephele is a microbiome analysis engine which brings together microbiome data and analysis tools in a cloud computing environment. It offers robust, multi-step microbiome analysis pipelines, with no setup time or cost.

[National Center for Data to Health (CD2H)](https://ctsa.ncats.nih.gov/cd2h/about/) - [NCATS] - Informatics advancements, coupled with a shift towards open science, are in the process of fundamentally transforming how we approach translational research and clinical care. The CTSA Program is poised to help realize precision medicine by leveraging informatics tools and expertise within CTSA hubs to solve key informatics challenges across the translational spectrum. The CD2H, launched in fall 2017, is tasked with coordinating and integrating informatics for the CTSA Program to promote data reuse and interoperability, tool sharing, informatics fluency, and collaboration. We are here to help by creating additional resources, building impactful infrastructure, and further coalescing the community to develop and implement innovative solutions.

[NCI Cloud Resources](https://cbiit.cancer.gov/ncip/crdc-cloud-resources) - The Cloud Resources bring together data and computation in a cloud-based environment to enable cancer research and discovery.  The NCI Cloud Resources, launched as a pilot program in 2016, are providing cancer researchers access to genomic data co-located with elastic compute and a variety of analytic tools and pipelines, in a cloud environment. Many in the cancer research community have come to rely on the Cloud Resources built by the Broad Institute, the Institute for Systems Biology (ISB), and Seven Bridges (SB) for their cancer research.  

[Nephele](https://nephele.niaid.nih.gov/) - Nephele is a web-based platform for microbiome data analysis. It was developed by scientists at the National Institutes of Health to make microbiome analysis easier, streamlined, and more accessible for a variety of users.  Microbiome analysis is a growing area of science and medicine. It generates an enormous amount of raw data and requires advanced quantitative analysis. Technical capacity to analyze microbiome data – namely, analyzing, transferring, and storing biomedical "big data"— is a major challenge in this type of research. Nephele addresses these challenges through cloud-based computing, integrating open source microbiome data analysis and visualization tools into an intuitive user interface.  Like its namesake, a Greek mythological nymph who was molded from a cloud by Zeus, Nephele (pronounced ne-FEH-lee) is a powerful scientific tool created from a cloud-based environment.
